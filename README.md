Title:
Classification of Rumor Labels using Machine Learning Models

Description:
This repository contains code for training and evaluating various machine learning models to predict rumor labels based on text data. The models are trained on a dataset (newdataset.csv) containing text samples and corresponding rumor labels.

Files:
newdataset.csv: Dataset containing sourceid,source,rumor labels and text.
coapps_fpr.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model as a pickle file.
rumor_classifier.pkl: Pickle file containing the trained random forest model.
README.md: This file.
Usage:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

The newdataset.csv file contains the dataset. Load the dataset and explore its structure using pandas.
Preprocess the text data (e.g., removing stopwords, tokenization, vectorization).
Model Training and Evaluation:

Train multiple classification models (LinearSVC, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree) on the preprocessed text data.
Evaluate each model's performance using accuracy and classification report.
Model Serialization:

Save the trained LinearSVC model as a pickle file (rumor_classifier.pkl) using the pickle module.
Model Deployment:

Load the serialized model from rumor_classifier.pkl into rumor_classification_app.py and run stramlit run rumor_classification_app.py
in command prompt to make classification of rumors.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, streamlit
Instructions:
Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
Execute the Jupyter Notebook rumor_label_prediction.ipynb to train models and save the LinearSVC model.
Use the saved model (rumor_classifier.pkl) for prediction by providing input text.
